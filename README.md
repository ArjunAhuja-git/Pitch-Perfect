# Pitch-Perfect
I really Enjoyed doing this project as a part of introductory course of IOS Development(Udacity).

This is a XCODE project so open it using xcode and press the run button and whalaaaa! a simulater should open and 
now you are all ready to use the project.

# Working
1.First it records a Audio file(Using AVfoundation class)  
2.Then it directs the user to try out some fun transformations to the audio file  
3.The user just has to click the button corresponding to what he/she wants to do   
  eg.snail-->slow,rabbit-->fast  
4.User can start/stop the recording any time,using the start/stop audio button.  

# Features of IOS Development Used:
1.Adding IBActions and IBOutlets to the buttons.(for functionality)    
2.StackViews(Horizontal and Vertical).  
3.Creating and manging multiple views.  
4.Segue for passing and recieving data between various views.
